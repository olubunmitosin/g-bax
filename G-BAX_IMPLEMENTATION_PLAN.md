# ðŸš€ G-Bax Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
**G-Bax** is a 3D blockchain-powered space exploration and crafting game that uses Honeycomb Protocol for on-chain progression, Three.js for immersive 3D experiences, and Verxio for loyalty systems.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 + React 18 + TypeScript
- **UI Framework**: HeroUI + Tailwind CSS  
- **3D Engine**: Three.js + React Three Fiber
- **Blockchain**: Solana + Honeycomb Protocol + Verxio
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Deployment**: Vercel/Netlify

## Core Game Mechanics
- **Explore** 3D space sectors and discover resource nodes
- **Mine** cosmic materials through Honeycomb missions
- **Forge** items that grant permanent on-chain traits
- **Progress** through crafter guilds with Verxio loyalty tiers
- **Compete** on leaderboards for reputation and rewards

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Foundation & Setup
- [ ] Initialize Next.js 14 project with TypeScript
- [ ] Install and configure UI dependencies (HeroUI, Tailwind CSS)
- [ ] Set up Solana wallet integration
- [ ] Install Three.js and React Three Fiber
- [ ] Configure project structure and tooling (Zustand, ESLint, Prettier)

### Phase 2: Core 3D Environment
- [ ] Create basic 3D space scene with starfield background
- [ ] Implement camera controls and navigation (orbital controls, WASD movement)
- [ ] Design space sectors and resource nodes (procedural asteroid fields)
- [ ] Add player ship and movement mechanics (physics-based movement)
- [ ] Create interactive object system (resource node detection)

### Phase 3: Honeycomb Integration 
- [ ] Set up Honeycomb Protocol SDK
- [ ] Design mission system architecture (mining, crafting, exploration quests)
- [ ] Implement trait assignment mechanics (mining efficiency, crafting mastery)
- [ ] Create on-chain progression tracking (XP systems, achievements)
- [ ] Build mission completion workflows (UI and reward distribution)

### Phase 4: Game Mechanics & UI 
- [ ] Implement resource mining mechanics (extraction, inventory management)
- [ ] Create item forging and crafting system (recipes, material requirements)
- [ ] Build responsive game UI with NextUI (inventory, missions, crafting panels)
- [ ] Design inventory and equipment system (item storage, equipment slots)
- [ ] Add game state management (Zustand stores for progress tracking)

### Phase 5: Verxio Loyalty System 
- [ ] Integrate Verxio SDK and authentication
- [ ] Design crafter guild system (miners, forgers, explorers specializations)
- [ ] Implement loyalty tiers and multipliers (tier benefits, XP bonuses)
- [ ] Create reputation tracking system (mission completion, crafting quality)
- [ ] Build guild progression UI (status, loyalty progress, tier advancement)

### Phase 6: Polish & Deployment 
- [ ] Create leaderboards and competitive features (rankings, achievements)
- [ ] Optimize 3D performance and mobile responsiveness (LOD systems)
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation (README, API docs, game guide)
- [ ] Record demo video walkthrough (3-minute feature demonstration)
- [ ] Deploy to production and test (Vercel/Netlify, devnet/mainnet testing)


## Key Success Metrics
- âœ… Meaningful Honeycomb integration (not just backend utility)
- âœ… Creative 3D space exploration experience
- âœ… On-chain progression that persists across sessions
- âœ… Mobile-responsive design with clean UI
- âœ… Working prototype on devnet/mainnet

## Game Design Details
